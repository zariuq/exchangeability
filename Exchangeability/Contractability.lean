# Contractability and Exchangeability

This file establishes the relationship between **exchangeability** and **contractability**
for infinite sequences of random variables, following Kallenberg's "Probabilistic
Symmetries and Invariance Principles" (2005).

## Main definitions

* `Exchangeable μ X`: The sequence `X` is exchangeable under measure `μ` if its
  finite-dimensional distributions are invariant under finite permutations.
* `FullyExchangeable μ X`: The sequence is fully exchangeable if invariant under
  *all* permutations of ℕ (not just finite ones).
* `Contractable μ X`: The sequence is contractable if all strictly increasing
  subsequences of equal length have the same distribution.

## Main results

* `FullyExchangeable.exchangeable`: Full exchangeability implies (finite) exchangeability.
* `contractable_of_exchangeable`: **Exchangeable ⇒ contractable** (via permutation extension).
* `exists_perm_extending_strictMono`: Key combinatorial lemma showing that any strictly
  monotone function `k : Fin m → ℕ` can be extended to a permutation of `Fin n`.

## The de Finetti-Ryll-Nardzewski equivalence

The full theorem establishes the equivalence for infinite sequences:
  **contractable ↔ exchangeable ↔ conditionally i.i.d.**

This file proves the implication **exchangeable → contractable** using a permutation
extension argument.

### The complete picture

- **Exchangeable → contractable** (this file): Any strictly increasing subsequence
  can be realized as the image of the first m coordinates under some permutation.
- **Contractable → exchangeable** (`Exchangeability/DeFinetti/Theorem.lean`): Uses ergodic
  theory and the martingale convergence approach.
- **Exchangeable ↔ fully exchangeable** (`Exchangeability/Exchangeability.lean`):
  Uses π-system uniqueness and finite approximation of infinite permutations.
- **Conditionally i.i.d. → exchangeable** (`Exchangeability/ConditionallyIID.lean`):
  Directly from the definition.

## Implementation notes

The key technical challenge is constructing permutations that extend strictly monotone
selections. Given `k : Fin m → ℕ` with `k(0) < k(1) < ... < k(m-1)`, we construct
a permutation `σ : Perm (Fin n)` such that `σ(i) = k(i)` for `i < m`. This uses
`Equiv.extendSubtype` to extend a bijection between subtypes to a full permutation.

A sequence of random variables is **exchangeable** if permuting finitely many indices
preserves the joint distribution.

Formally, for every `n` and every permutation `σ` of `Fin n`, the distribution of
`(X_{σ(0)}, ..., X_{σ(n-1)})` equals the distribution of `(X_0, ..., X_{n-1})`.

This is the central notion in de Finetti's theorem.

      Measure.map (fun ω => fun i : Fin n => X i ω) μ

/--
A sequence is **fully exchangeable** if permuting *any* indices preserves the distribution.

This is stronger than `Exchangeable` because it requires invariance under *all*
permutations of ℕ, not just finite ones. However, `Exchangeability.lean` proves
that these notions are equivalent for probability measures.

Formally, for every permutation `π : Perm ℕ`, the distribution of the reindexed
sequence `(X_{π(0)}, X_{π(1)}, ...)` equals the distribution of `(X_0, X_1, ...)`.

Extend a finite permutation to a permutation of ℕ by fixing points ≥ n.

Given a permutation `σ` of `Fin n`, this produces a permutation of ℕ that acts
as σ on `{0, ..., n-1}` and fixes all `i ≥ n`.

This is used to connect full exchangeability with finite exchangeability.

Full exchangeability implies exchangeability.

If a sequence is invariant under all permutations of ℕ, it is certainly invariant
under finite permutations. The proof uses `extendFinPerm` to view a finite

A sequence is **contractable** if all strictly increasing subsequences of equal
length have the same distribution.

**Definition:** For any `m` and any strictly increasing function `k : Fin m → ℕ`,
the distribution of `(X_{k(0)}, ..., X_{k(m-1)})` equals the distribution of
`(X_0, ..., X_{m-1})`.

**Intuition:** Contractability is weaker than exchangeability. While exchangeability
requires invariance under all permutations, contractability only requires invariance
under "order-preserving selections" - we can choose any m indices as long as they
are in increasing order.

**Example:** For i.i.d. sequences, any increasing subsequence has the same
distribution as the initial segment, so contractability holds.

This is a key property in de Finetti's theorem, equivalent to both exchangeability
and conditional independence.

Any two strictly increasing subsequences of the same length have equal distributions.

`(X_{k₂(0)}, ..., X_{k₂(m-1)})` have the same distribution whenever both `k₁` and
`k₂` are strictly increasing, regardless of which specific indices are chosen.

This is the key property that makes contractability useful: the distribution
depends only on the length of the subsequence, not on which increasing subsequence
is selected.

Any strictly increasing function can be extended to a permutation.

**Statement:** Given a strictly increasing `k : Fin m → ℕ` with all values `< n`
and `m ≤ n`, there exists a permutation `σ : Perm (Fin n)` such that
`σ(i) = k(i)` for all `i < m`.

**Intuition:** We want to build a permutation that "realizes" the selection `k`
as the image of the first `m` positions. Since `k` is strictly increasing, it's
injective, so its image has cardinality `m`. We can extend this to a full
permutation by arbitrarily pairing up the remaining elements.

**Construction outline:**
1. **Domain partition:** `{0,...,m-1}` ∪ `{m,...,n-1}` = `Fin n`
2. **Codomain partition:** `{k(0),...,k(m-1)}` ∪ `complement` = `Fin n`
3. Map first `m` positions to `k`-values: `σ(i) = k(i)` for `i < m`
4. Extend arbitrarily to remaining positions using `Equiv.extendSubtype`

This is the key combinatorial lemma enabling `contractable_of_exchangeable`:
any strictly increasing subsequence can be realized via a permutation.

**Main theorem:** Every exchangeable sequence is contractable.

**Statement:** If `X` is exchangeable, then any strictly increasing subsequence
has the same distribution as the initial segment.

**Proof strategy:**
1. Given a strictly increasing `k : Fin m → ℕ`, choose `n` large enough to
   contain all `k(i)` values.
2. Use `exists_perm_extending_strictMono` to construct a permutation `σ : Perm (Fin n)`
   such that `σ(i) = k(i)` for `i < m`.
3. Apply exchangeability: the distributions under `σ` and the identity are equal.
4. Project both sides to the first `m` coordinates to conclude that
   `(X_{k(0)}, ..., X_{k(m-1)})` has the same distribution as `(X_0, ..., X_{m-1})`.

**Mathematical significance:** This shows that exchangeability (invariance under
all finite permutations) implies contractability (invariance under increasing
selections). The converse requires ergodic theory and is much deeper.

This is one direction of de Finetti's theorem.
