# Exchangeability and Full Exchangeability

This file proves that **exchangeability** (invariance under finite permutations)
and **full exchangeability** (invariance under all permutations of ℕ) are
equivalent for probability measures on sequence spaces.

## Main results

* `exchangeable_iff_fullyExchangeable`: For a probability measure and a
  measurable stochastic process, exchangeability is equivalent to full
  exchangeability.
* `measure_eq_of_fin_marginals_eq`: Two finite measures on `ℕ → α` that agree
  on all finite-dimensional marginals are equal.

## Technical approach

The proof uses the **π-system uniqueness theorem** for finite measures rather than
directly invoking Kolmogorov extension or Ionescu-Tulcea. While mathlib provides
these powerful tools (`Measure.infinitePi` for Kolmogorov extension and
`ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.traj` for Ionescu-Tulcea), applying them here would
require first constructing the measure from exchangeability data, which is
circular when proving that finite exchangeability implies full exchangeability.

Instead, we use a **uniqueness-based approach**:

1. Cylinder sets determined by initial segments form a π-system that generates
   the product σ-algebra on `ℕ → α`.
2. Two measures with matching finite marginals must be equal (by π-system
   uniqueness, `Measure.ext_of_generate_finite`).
3. Any infinite permutation can be approximated by a finite permutation on a
   sufficiently large initial segment, allowing us to transfer exchangeability
   to full exchangeability via the uniqueness result.

This approach directly proves the equivalence without requiring measure
construction machinery.

## π-system of prefix cylinders

A **prefix cylinder** is a measurable subset of `ℕ → α` determined by the first
`n` coordinates. Formally, it is the preimage of a measurable set under the
projection to `Fin n → α`.

**Key properties:**
* Prefix cylinders form a π-system (closed under finite intersections).
* They generate the product σ-algebra on `ℕ → α`.
* This allows us to apply the π-system uniqueness theorem: two finite measures
  that agree on all prefix cylinders must be equal.

Finite measures with matching finite-dimensional marginals are equal.

If two finite measures on `ℕ → α` induce the same distribution on each
finite-dimensional projection `Fin n → α`, then they are equal. This is a
consequence of the π-system uniqueness theorem applied to prefix cylinders.

**Mathematical content:** This is a Kolmogorov extension-type result showing
that infinite-dimensional measures are determined by their finite marginals.

**Proof structure:** The proof decomposes into three steps:
1. Measures agree on total mass (via 1-dimensional marginal)
2. Measures agree on all prefix cylinders (direct from marginals)
3. Apply π-system uniqueness to extend agreement to all measurable sets

## Exchangeability versus full exchangeability

This section proves that exchangeability (invariance under finite permutations)
implies full exchangeability (invariance under all permutations of ℕ) for
probability measures.

**Strategy:** Given an arbitrary permutation π of ℕ and a finite index n, we
construct a finite permutation that agrees with π on the first n coordinates.
Exchangeability ensures the finite marginals match, and by the previous
uniqueness result, the full measures are equal.

### Auxiliary combinatorics: approximating infinite permutations

To prove that exchangeability implies full exchangeability, we need to show that
any infinite permutation π of ℕ can be approximated by a finite permutation on
a sufficiently large initial segment.

The key construction: given π and n, we find a bound `m = permBound π n` such
that both `{0,...,n-1}` and `{π(0),...,π(n-1)}` lie in `{0,...,m-1}`. Then we
extend π to a permutation of `Fin m` by choosing an arbitrary permutation on the
remaining indices.

Exchangeability implies invariance of all finite marginals under arbitrary permutations.

If a process `X` is exchangeable (invariant under finite permutations), then
each finite marginal is invariant under *any* permutation of ℕ, not just finite
ones. This is the key step in proving exchangeability implies full exchangeability.

**Proof idea:** Given an arbitrary permutation π and dimension n, construct a
finite permutation that agrees with π on the first n coordinates using
`approxPerm`. Exchangeability ensures this finite permutation preserves the
n-dimensional marginal, hence so does π.

**Main theorem:** Exchangeability and full exchangeability are equivalent.

For a probability measure and a measurable stochastic process, invariance under
finite permutations (exchangeability) is equivalent to invariance under all
permutations of ℕ (full exchangeability).

**Mathematical significance:** This shows that the seemingly stronger condition
of full exchangeability is automatic once exchangeability holds. This is a
consequence of the Kolmogorov extension principle: infinite-dimensional
measures are determined by their finite-dimensional marginals.

**Proof strategy:**
- (⇒) Use `marginals_perm_eq` to show all finite marginals are invariant under
  arbitrary permutations, then apply `measure_eq_of_fin_marginals_eq`.
- (⇐) Full exchangeability trivially implies exchangeability by restriction.
