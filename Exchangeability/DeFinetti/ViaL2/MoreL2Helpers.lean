# Additional L² Helpers and Incomplete Lemmas

This file contains technical lemmas and placeholder definitions that support
the L² proof of de Finetti's theorem. Some lemmas have `sorry` placeholders
that will eventually be replaced with proper proofs from mathlib or local implementations.

## Contents

* Elementary helpers (clip01, Lipschitz properties)
* L¹ convergence helpers
* Boundedness helpers
* AE strong measurability helpers
* Deep results requiring further work (marked with sorry)

## Note

The incomplete lemmas in this file are placeholders for complex proofs that are deferred
to allow the main proof structure to be complete. Each sorry can be replaced with
a proper proof.

This section contains forward declarations and placeholder definitions for deep results.
Each sorry can be replaced with a proper proof from mathlib or a local implementation.

-- Note: The definitions alphaIic, cdf_from_alpha, directing_measure, alphaIic_measurable,
-- and weighted_sums_converge_L1 are in MainConvergence.lean and will be available when
-- MainConvergence imports MoreL2Helpers.

-- Axiom for CDF limit behavior.
--
-- **MATHEMATICAL NOTE:** This axiom requires the CDF limits to hold for ALL ω.
-- However, from the L¹ construction of `alphaIic`, we can only prove a.e. convergence:
-- - `alphaIic_ae_tendsto_zero_at_bot` in MainConvergence.lean
-- - `alphaIic_ae_tendsto_one_at_top` in MainConvergence.lean
--
/-- CDF limits at ±∞: F(t) → 0 as t → -∞ and F(t) → 1 as t → +∞.

This is now trivial because `cdf_from_alpha` is defined via `stieltjesOfMeasurableRat`,
which guarantees these limits for ALL ω (not just a.e.) by construction.

The `stieltjesOfMeasurableRat` construction automatically patches the null set where
the raw L¹ limit `alphaIic` would fail to have proper CDF limits. -/

/-! ### Linearity of L¹ Limits

The following lemmas establish that the L¹ limit functional from `weighted_sums_converge_L1`
is linear: if f and g have L¹ limits α_f and α_g, then f + g has limit α_f + α_g,
and c * f has limit c * α_f.

These are essential for the functional monotone class argument that extends from
indicators of half-lines to all bounded measurable functions.

-- LINEARITY LEMMAS for the functional monotone class argument
--
-- These lemmas establish that the L¹ limit functional from `weighted_sums_converge_L1`
-- is linear and continuous. They are essential for extending the base case
-- (indicators of half-lines) to all bounded measurable functions.
--
-- PROOF STRATEGY: Each follows from:
-- 1. The Cesàro averages satisfy the algebraic identity
--    (e.g., (1/N) Σ c*f(X_k) = c * (1/N) Σ f(X_k))
-- 2. L¹ limits are unique up to a.e. equality
-- 3. Therefore the limits satisfy the same identity
--
-- These are routine but require careful handling of the existential .choose

/-- Scalar multiplication of L¹ limits: if f has L¹ limit α, then c*f has L¹ limit c*α. -/

/-- **Packaged directing measure theorem:** Existence of a directing kernel with all
key properties bundled together.

For a contractable sequence X on ℝ, there exists:
1. A limit function α ∈ L¹ that is the L¹ limit of Cesàro averages
2. A random probability measure ν(·) on ℝ (the directing measure)
3. The identification α = ∫ f dν a.e.

This packages the outputs of `directing_measure` and `directing_measure_integral`
into a single existential statement that is convenient for applications.

**Proof:** Follows directly from `directing_measure_integral` which provides
the limit α and its identification with ∫ f dν, combined with
`directing_measure_isProbabilityMeasure` and `directing_measure_measurable`.

/-- The integral of `alphaIic` equals the marginal probability.

By the L¹ convergence property of the Cesàro averages and contractability
(which implies all marginals are equal), we have:
  ∫ alphaIic(t, ω) dμ = μ(X_0 ∈ Iic t)

This is a key step in proving the bridge property.

**Proof outline**:
1. alphaIic is the clipped L¹ limit of Cesàro averages of 1_{Iic t}(X_i)
2. By L¹ convergence: ∫ (limit) dμ = lim ∫ (Cesàro average) dμ
3. By contractability: each μ(X_i ∈ Iic t) = μ(X_0 ∈ Iic t)
4. Therefore: ∫ alphaIic dμ = μ(X_0 ∈ Iic t)

For the bridge property, we need to convert an injective function `k : Fin m → ℕ`
to a strictly monotone one. This is done by sorting the image of k.

**Note:** The lemma `injective_implies_strictMono_perm` is now in

For Route B, we need: if each factor converges in L¹, then the product converges in L¹
(under boundedness assumptions).
-/

/-- Product of L¹-convergent bounded sequences converges in L¹.

If f_n(i) → g(i) in L¹ for each i, and all functions are bounded by 1,
then ∏_i f_n(i) → ∏_i g(i) in L¹.

**Proof:** By `abs_prod_sub_prod_le`, we have pointwise:
  |∏_i f_n(i) - ∏_i g(i)| ≤ ∑_j |f_n(j) - g(j)|

Integrating and using Fubini:
  ∫ |∏ f - ∏ g| ≤ ∫ ∑_j |f_j - g_j| = ∑_j ∫ |f_j - g_j|

The RHS tends to 0 by h_conv and `tendsto_finset_sum`.

/-- Block index function is strictly monotone.

For the block-separated approach, we define indices using disjoint ordered blocks:
  k_φ(i) := i * N + φ(i)  for φ : Fin m → Fin N

This is STRICTLY MONOTONE for any φ because:
  k_φ(i) = i * N + φ(i) ≤ i * N + (N-1) < (i+1) * N ≤ k_φ(i+1)

This is the key insight that makes the block-separated approach work:
every selection is StrictMono, so contractability applies to EVERY term
(no exchangeability required).

/-! ### Original proof structure (commented out due to incomplete lemmas)

The original proof attempted to show:
1. Reduce injective k to strictly monotone via permutation
2. Use contractability for distributional equality
3. Apply U-statistic expansion for product expectations
4. Conclude via L¹ convergence of block averages

Key intermediate lemmas that need completion:
- h_pblock_vs_shifted: Bound on shifted averages
- h_L1_shifted_ref: L¹ bound from L² via Cauchy-Schwarz
- h_block_L1: Product L¹ convergence
-/

/-- **Main packaging theorem for L² proof.**

This theorem packages all the directing measure properties needed by
`CommonEnding.complete_from_directing_measure`:

1. `ν` is a probability measure for all ω
2. `ω ↦ ν(ω)(s)` is measurable for all measurable sets s
3. The bridge property: E[∏ᵢ 1_{Bᵢ}(X_{k(i)})] = E[∏ᵢ ν(·)(Bᵢ)]

This enables the final step of the L² proof of de Finetti's theorem.
